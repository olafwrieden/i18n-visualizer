# i18n Visualizer
A new way to humanly source i18n translations by comparing a reference language side-by-side with the target language.

## Project Vision
- Owner signs in with GitHub, to create a project.
- Owner provides source language files in JSON.
- App extracts key/value pairs and adds them to a source data set.
- Owner can link screenshots to show the text in context (ie. the button on a page).

- Translator signs in with GitHub.
- Translator selects a project to translate.
- App displays the source texts and text boxes for target text.
- Translator translates source text to target language.
- Translator submits the translation.
- Translator is rewarded 10 points for their effort.

- Owner sees the translation with a confidence level of accuracy.
- Translator can approve existing translations for the key/value or add a new one they believe to be better.
